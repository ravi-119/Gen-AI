Why Take This Course?

This course combines theory, coding, and deployment in one place. You’ll start from the basics of Python and Git, and by the end, you’ll be coding cutting-edge AI applications with LangChain, LangGraph, Ollama, Hugging Face, and more.

Unlike other courses, this one doesn’t stop at “calling APIs.” You will go deeper into system design, queues, scaling, memory, and graph-powered AI agents — everything you need to stand out as an AI Engineer.

By the end of this course, you won’t just understand AI—you’ll be able to build it.

What you’ll learn
Write Python programs from scratch, using Git for version control and Docker for deployment.
Use Pydantic to handle structured data and validation in Python applications.
Understand how Large Language Models (LLMs) work: tokenization, embeddings, attention, and transformers.
Call and integrate APIs from OpenAI and Gemini with Python.
Design effective prompts: zero-shot, one-shot, few-shot, chain-of-thought, persona-based, and structured prompting.
